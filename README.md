# random-utils-ir
A random set of scripts I have needed to write at some point - mostly written in Node.js or Bash.
> Note:
> - `npm i` may need to be run to install dependencies before using some of the Node scripts.
> - Bash scripts may depend on various packages that need to be installed manually
